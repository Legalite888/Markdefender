## 🚀 How to Launch Online

### 1. Host on Vercel (Fastest)
1. **Create a GitHub Repo**: Upload all project files to a new repository.
2. **Link to Vercel**: Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and click "Add New Project." Import your GitHub repo.
3. **Environment Variable**: This is the most important step.
   - Go to **Settings > Environment Variables**.
   - Name: `API_KEY`
   - Value: [Your Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio]
4. **Deploy**: Hit "Deploy" and your professional IP assistant is live!

### 2. Host on Netlify

## 🔑 Gemini API Keys
- Obtain your key at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/).
- **Pro Tip**: To use the high-fidelity "Infringement Comparison" tool, you must use an API key from a **Paid Google Cloud Project**. Free tier keys may result in errors for vision-heavy analysis.

Our AI uses real-time search grounding to cross-reference:
- **WIPO**: World Intellectual Property Organization (Madrid System)
